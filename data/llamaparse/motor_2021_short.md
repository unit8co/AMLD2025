# Part A: Loss and damage

## What is covered

1. Loss of or damage to your car or spare parts

If your car, accessories or spare parts are lost, stolen or damaged, we will:

- repair the damage;
- replace what is lost or damaged and is too expensive to repair; or
- pay you the cost of the loss or damage.

We can choose which of these actions we will take for any claim we agree to and the repairer can use parts that have not been produced by the vehicle manufacturer.

If your car is damaged, we will use one of our recommended repairers to repair it. If you choose not to use them, we may not pay more than our recommended repairer would have charged and we may choose to settle the claim by a financial payment. Following damage to your car, we may move your car to a place of safe and free storage pending settlement of any claim.

If you cannot use your car because of loss or damage that is insured under this policy, we will also pay the reasonable cost of protecting your car and taking it to our nearest recommended repairer. After the repair, we will pay the reasonable cost of delivering your car to your address in the UK.

Where your car is not recovered following a theft or is beyond economical repair we will pay you the market value of your car, including accessories and spare parts at the time they are lost, stolen or damaged.

If we settle a claim as a total loss, we will then take ownership of your car.

Accessories and spare parts of your car, which are in your private garage at the time of their loss or damage, will also be covered.

and provided your car is owned by you then we will replace your car with a new one of the same make, model and specification.

Provided that:
- one is available
- you and anyone else we know who has a financial interest in your car agree.

If your car is recovered before a new replacement is ordered and the cost of repairs are less than 60% of the manufacturers list price, we will do one of the following:

- repair the damage
