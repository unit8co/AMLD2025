Provided that:

### Useful information:

† This policy does not cover mechanical breakdown, or computer failure. But, if for example your engine management system fails and causes the engine to shut down, any accident that happens as a result would be covered (although the cost to repair the fault of the engine management system would not be covered). The same applies if your vehicle catches fire – the faulty item would not be covered, but you would be covered for the other fire damage.

*Examples of such loss, damage or additional expense are the costs incurred in preparing a claim or loss of earnings following your bodily injury or illness.

** Excesses

The excess is the amount you have to pay for every claim for loss of or damage to your vehicle (for example, if your repairs cost £1,000 and you have a £100 excess, you pay £100 and the insurer pays £900). Excesses apply whoever was to blame.

^You can save money by having the glass repaired instead of replaced. Ask the glass supplier to check the damage to see whether it can be repaired. Have your certificate of insurance ready when you have the glass repaired or replaced. The glass repairer needs this for your claim.

### 1 Cover provided for you

This policy covers you for the amounts shown below:

a Death of or injury to any person unlimited.

b Damage to any other person's property up to £20,000,000, plus all legal costs and expenses provided the total does not exceed £25,000,000

which you become legally responsible for paying due to the death of or injury to any person and damage to any person's property in respect of any claim or series of claims arising out of one event involving your car, or caused by a trailer, caravan or other vehicle that is attached to your car.

The same cover will apply if you are driving any other car which your certificate of insurance allows you to drive. This cover ceases if you dispose of your car shown in the certificate of insurance or it becomes a total loss.*

### 2 Cover provided for other people

If you ask us to, we will give the following people the same level of cover as provided in 1 above

- Anyone you allow to drive your car and who is allowed to drive it in the certificate of insurance.

- Any person using (but not driving) your car with your permission for social, domestic and pleasure purposes.

- Any person travelling in or getting into or out of your car.

- Your employer or business partner, as long as your car is not owned by or hired to either your employer or business partner and your car is being used for a purpose that is allowed in your certificate of insurance.

### 3 Your legally-appointed representatives

After the death of anyone insured under this policy, we will protect that person's estate against any liability the deceased person had if that liability is insured under this policy.

### 4 Legal fees and expenses

If we give our written permission, we will pay for solicitors fees to:

- represent anyone insured under this policy at any Coroner's Inquest or Fatal Accident Inquiry; or
- defend anyone insured under this policy in a court of summary jurisdiction;

for any incident which might give rise to a claim under Part B – Liability to others of this policy.

### 5 Proceedings for manslaughter or causing death by dangerous driving

We will pay fees for legal services to defend anyone insured under this policy if legal proceedings are taken against that person for manslaughter or causing death by reckless driving. The following conditions will apply to this cover:

- You must ask us to provide it.
- The death or deaths giving rise to the proceedings must have been caused by an incident covered by this policy.

### 6 Emergency medical treatment

We will pay for any emergency medical treatment that must be provided under the Road Traffic Act. If this is the only payment we make, it will not affect your no claim discount.

Part B: Liability to others continued

## What is not covered

You are not covered for the following:

1. Anyone driving your car who is disqualified from driving or has never held a driving licence, or is prevented by law from holding one.

2. Liability for loss of or damage to property which belongs to, or is with, any person who is insured under this policy and who is driving your car.

3. Any loss of or damage to property, legal liability, injury or other loss directly or indirectly caused by, contributed to by or arising from terrorism or any action taken in controlling preventing suppressing or in any way relating to terrorism. However this policy covers you so far as is necessary to meet any law on compulsory insurance.

For the purposes of this exclusion terrorism means any act or acts that the government of the United Kingdom considers to be an act of terrorism or any act which could be defined as terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2000 and/or subsequent acts pertaining to terrorism. This involves but is not limited to the use of or threat of action, force or violence by any person or group of people acting alone or on behalf of any organisation or government. This could be for political, religious, ideological or similar reasons. This includes trying to influence any government or intimidate the public.

### Useful information:

* If an accident causes damage to another car, an animal or property, or if anyone is injured, the law says you must stop. You must give your name, address and car registration number to anyone reasonably asking.

# Part C: Territorial limits and foreign use

## What is covered

This policy provides the cover described in the schedule within the UK.

Your policy also provides the minimum cover you need by law to use your car in:

1. any country which is a member of the European Community; or
2. any other country which has agreed to follow Article 8 of the EU Directive 2009/103/EC relating to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and is approved by the commission of the European Communities. We will also provide this cover while your car is being transported between any of those countries and the UK.

Where the level of cover in any European Community Member State is less than that provided by the legal minimum requirements of UK, the level of cover that applies in UK will apply in that Member State.

Your policy automatically extends the cover shown in the schedule to the countries described in 1 and 2 above for up to 93 days in any one period of cover.

If you want to extend your cover for more than 93 days you must contact us before you travel.

It is no longer necessary to have an International Motor Insurance Certificate (Green card) when travelling to countries covered by 1 or 2 above. In the absence of a Green card you must carry your current certificate of insurance when travelling.

If you plan to travel to any other country, please notify us at least three weeks before you leave as you may require a Green card, which may be supplied if we agree to extend cover. An additional premium may be charged for this additional cover.

When contacting us please supply the following information:

- your policy number
- the period for which cover is required
- the registration number, make and model of your car
- details of any trailer or caravan being towed
- countries to be visited.

## What is not covered

You are not covered for any legal action taken against you outside the UK, unless it is a result of using your car in a country for which we have agreed to extend this insurance cover.

# Part F: Additional covers and benefits

## 1 No claims discount

As long as a claim has not been made on your policy during the current period of cover, we will include a discount in your renewal premium. We will give you a discount for each claim-free year up to the maximum entitlement.

Please note this is no guarantee your premium will not rise.

The table below shows what would happen to your NCD if you were to make one or more claims.

| No Claims Discount at Next Renewal Date without NCD Protection |                                    |                                     |                                     |                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |

| 1 year                                                         | Nil                                | Nil                                 | Nil                                 | Nil                                         |
| 2 years                                                        | Nil                                | Nil                                 | Nil                                 | Nil                                         |
| 3 years                                                        | 1                                  | Nil                                 | Nil                                 | Nil                                         |
| 4 years                                                        | 2                                  | Nil                                 | Nil                                 | Nil                                         |

Your no claims discount will not be affected by payments for emergency treatment which the Road Traffic Act says we must pay or payments made under Part A (2) – Windscreen Damage for windscreen replacement/repair.

## 2 Protected no claims discount

Once you have five years no claims discount and a claim has not been made on your policy for at least three years, if you are aged at least 25 years and all drivers are aged at least 21 years, then you can protect the discount if you pay an extra premium at each renewal.

No claims bonus protection does not protect the overall price of your insurance policy. The price of your insurance policy may increase following an accident even if you were not at fault.

No claims bonus protection allows you to make one or more claims before your number of no claims bonus years falls.
---
Part F: Additional covers and benefits continued

## 3 Uninsured driver promise

If you have comprehensive cover and you make a claim where the driver of the other car involved in the accident is found to be uninsured, you will not have to pay your excess or lose any part of your no claims discount (NCD) as long as:

- You are able to provide the make, model and registration number of the other car involved, and
- We can establish that you were not at fault in any way.

It will also help if you are able to provide the details of the other driver involved and details of any independent witnesses if possible.

When you first claim you may have to pay your excess and your NCD may be affected. However, once we have established that you were not at fault in any way and the driver of the other car was uninsured, your excess will be refunded to you and your NCD restored.

## 4 Car sharing

Your policy also covers your car when you are being paid for carrying passengers for social or similar purposes as long as:

- your car cannot carry more than 8 people including the driver;
- you are not carrying the passengers as part of a business of carrying passengers; and
- the total payment you receive for the journey does not provide a profit for you.

## 5 Car service cover

### Car servicing and car parking

Subject to the terms and conditions of this policy other than limitations to use and driving we will provide an indemnity to you whilst your car is in the custody or control of:

- A motor garage or other similar business, which you do not own, which has your car for the purpose of:
  - maintenance;
  - repair;
  - testing; or
  - servicing.
- A hotel, restaurant or similar business, which you do not own, where your car has been parked for you.

## 6 Driving other cars extension

Please refer to your certificate of insurance to see if you are covered to drive other cars which are not owned by you or under a hire purchase agreement, rental/short term hire agreement or annual leasing agreement to you. If your cover is extended to drive other private motor cars, subject to the criteria listed on your certificate of insurance, the cover when driving that vehicle will be limited to Third Party Cover. This means that the car that you are driving will not be covered itself.

Please note that if your certificate of insurance lists this cover then cover is restricted to you, the policyholder only, and not any other drivers named on this policy. This extension does not provide cover to drive vans, other commercial vehicles or motorbikes of any description.

You are not covered under this section whilst driving outside of the UK.

# How we use your data

## Data Protection Notice

AXA Insurance UK plc is part of the AXA Group of companies which takes your privacy very seriously. For details of how we use the personal information we collect from you and your rights please view our privacy policy at www.axa.co.uk/privacy-policy. If you do not have access to the internet please contact us and we will send you a printed copy.

## Motor Insurance Database

When you take out a car insurance policy, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database ("MID"), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre ("MIIC"). MID data may be used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland for the purpose of electronic vehicle licensing and by the police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's use of a vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident, whether in the UK or abroad, other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers'Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant policy information.

Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other EU countries) may be entitled to access relevant information held about you on the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or from the Motor Insurance Bureau.

# Important notes

## Motor Insurance law

DVLA will compare its records with details of vehicles on the MID (Motor Insurance Database) – the UK's central record of vehicle insurance.

If a vehicle does not have insurance and a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) has not been made, the registered keeper could face;

- a fixed penalty fine of £100
- their vehicle being clamped, seized and disposed of, and
- a court prosecution with a maximum fine of £1,000.

These measures are in addition to the powers the police already have to seize an uninsured vehicle and fine the driver.

If you want to check your vehicle is recorded as "insured" on the MID record, visit the free service at www.askMID.com

Do not contact DVLA as only your insurance provider can update your insurance details on the MID. If your vehicle registration number is not on the MID, contact your insurance provider immediately to get the MID updated.

## What this means for you

If you are keeping your vehicle for use on the road and it is not insured, insure it now. If you are keeping your vehicle off the road and it is not insured you must make a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN). If it is taxed you need to return the disc (including nil discs) on a V14 form to DVLA.
