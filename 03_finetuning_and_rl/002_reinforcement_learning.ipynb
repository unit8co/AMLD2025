    "##  Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently proheminent AI labs and researcher realised that large \"intelligence\" gained could be made by scaling inference time compute against the previous approach of scaling training time. This is the raise of all the \"reasoning model\" including openai o1 / o3 and more recently deepseek R1. What's great about deepseek R1 is unlike openAI they explained how they did it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the model \"reason\" hence scaling inference time compute, they used GRPO as we will use in this notebook to make our model reason about claims. The great added benefit about the deepseek approach is that the reasoning is clearly readable from the LLM generation.\n",

    "### Adding Claim Reasoning Capabilities to our model with Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will focus on Reinforcement Learning to improve further the performance of our small local Qwen2.5 3B. The promise of reinforcement learning is to let the model improve itself through some reward function. There are many variation of reward function and way of updating the model based on the reward that have been experimented with. The latest and greatest approach in terms of reinforcement learning algorithm is [GRPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300). It was developed by deepseek and is powering the reasoning capabilities of the famous Deepseek R1 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO is very close to previous approach Proximal Proxy Optimization PPO but uses several generation from the same policy model to see how good it perform on average and use this average instead of a dedicated value model to compute it's advantage and improve itself."
