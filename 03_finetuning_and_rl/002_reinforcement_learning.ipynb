    "##  Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, prominent AI labs and researchers discovered that significant gains in \"intelligence\" could be achieved by scaling inference time compute, rather than the traditional approach of scaling training time compute. This led to the rise of \"reasoning models\" including OpenAI's o1/o3 and more recently DeepSeek R1. What makes DeepSeek R1 particularly interesting is that, unlike OpenAI, they publicly shared their methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable model \"reasoning\" through scaled inference time compute, they utilized GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization), which we'll implement in this notebook to enhance our model's reasoning capabilities about claims. A significant advantage of the DeepSeek approach is that the model's reasoning process remains transparent and readable in its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Claim Reasoning Capabilities to our Model with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore Reinforcement Learning to further enhance the performance of our local Qwen2.5 3B model. Reinforcement learning allows the model to improve itself through reward functions. While many variations of reward functions and model update methods have been explored, the current state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning algorithms is [GRPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300). Developed by DeepSeek, this algorithm powers the reasoning capabilities of their renowned DeepSeek R1 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO builds upon the previous Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) approach but introduces a key innovation: instead of using a dedicated value model, it generates multiple outputs from the same policy model to assess average performance. This average is then used to compute the advantage and guide model improvement."
